# PO-Transformer

## Motivation

In some projects, I use [react-intl](https://github.com/formatjs/react-intl) to internationalize them and support multi-languages. React-intl supports flatted objects as JSON-files divided into separated named-files like `en_US.json` or `de_DE.json`.

Most of my clients use [POEdit](https://poedit.net) to manage multi-languages in their projects. And most translations agency known and used this tool too.

For these reasons I need something to transform flatted objects as JSON-files to PO-Files to open with POEdit - so this tool/repository was born.

## Features

- Transforms an existing JSON-File to a PO-File
- Transforms an existing PO-File to a JSON-File

## Usage

Transforms an existing JSON-File to a PO-File

```bash
$ npx poTransformer po --input examples/testData.json --output examples/testData.po
```

Transforms an existing PO-File to a JSON-File

```bash
$ npx poTransformer json --input examples/testData.po --output examples/testData.json
```

## Known Bugs

The current situation of this project is, that it works for my workflow and situations only. It's a very raw and straightforward implementation tailored exactly to what I need.
